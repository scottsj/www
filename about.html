    		<p>My goal in maintaining this website is simply to create a hobby platform where I can experiment with web technologies and share some of my experiences publicly.</p>
        		<p>Triathlon Calculator
             		is a simple tool I needed to plan my performance in an upcoming Half Ironman race, and while there were existing calculators available, none were particularly modern. TC is currently
             		a static JS application and I plan to incorporate react.js to enable persistent and sharable settings per visitor. Then, capturing user data to understand the spread of data entries of hobby
             		triathletes would be an interesting analytic exercise.</p>

      		  	<h2>background</h2>
      			</div>
	      <p>I grew up in the small town of Bright, Victoria, some years as a student of my father at the local school. I relocated to Melbourne
             to study Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Melbourne, and for three years I resided at Ormond College,
             a fantastic way to integrate into city life and make connections outside your field of study.</p>
          	<div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-body collapse">
      		  <div class="accordion-inner">
          <p>In 2005 I started my first fulltime role at a small (~7 staff) software development/services start-up focused on price optimization 
        	 within the insurance industry. At the time, my brightest colleagues 
             were abandoning engineering for more prestigious roles in business consulting, given 2005 was not a popular time for tech investment, and the
             start-up culture was a non-event in Australia. However, without even awareness of risks or the poor perception of joining a start-up,
             I chose an opportunity where I could develop both my technical and business strategy skills. This became the foundation of my career.</p>
          <p>In 2008 I stumbled upon Palantir, a small company (at the time) with tremendous confidence in delivering on a noble mission to be the analytic data hub for intelligence,
          	 defense and law enforcement communities. They were seeking an Australian citizen to support local interest in their platform, and I saw the opportunity to connect
          	 with the drive and talent of Silicon Valley, even if the company wasn't to succeed. Palantir went on to be one of the most respected data analytics companies in 
          	 the world, and I was lucky enough to ride this wave.</p>
          <p>I am a huge proponent of growing with a growing company, rather than growing through the ranks of an established company. In my time at Palantir, I had the opportunity
             to build out our earliest deployments and teams in Australia, New Zealand, UK, & Europe, reside in four different countries (Australia, UK, Netherlands, USA), manage large 
             teams of extremely talented engineers and analysts, and interact with very senior business counterparts including the directors and C-level of numerous government agencies
             and commercial enterprises. </p>
          <p>As Palantir has grown into an established private technology company, my goals are to continue to maintain my tech skills - hence
             the founding of this website - among other things.</p>
          <p>Spare time? You'll find me on my bike, or training for an upcoming triathlon. Find me on Strava and we'll go for a ride!</p>
